He then crossed the river to Montrose and healed many more there.  ("Leaves From My Journal," Millennial Star, Oct. 10th & 17th, 1881, p. 647-671)</p>
<p>Gold Plates - Once it was known that Joseph Smith had gold plates, every means and strategy was used to get them from him, including searches of his home and possessions.
