<H2>Why Scripture Creations</H2>
<H3>Scripture Creations main purposes are to Strengthen Families in Jesus Christ and to move the work of the Lord forward in new and creative ways. Making the Lord's work your work is extremely rewarding.  It makes it very easy to get and stay excited about what you are doing.  It is so much easier to sell products that you believe in.  Although most products will not make a significant impact on someone's testimony, each one adds a layer of strength to the people who use them.  Each sale has the potential for eternal growth, strength, and consequenses.  It is incredible to be involved in something with so much potential for good.

<H2>Why I HATE Multi-Level Marketing</H2>
<H3>
<UL>
<LI>I hate when most of the money in the system comes from Sign Up Charges
<UL>
<LI>Scripture Creations sign up costs go entirely to product and setup costs
</UL>
<LI>I hate having all my neighbors avoid me
<UL>
<LI>With a party plan, your hosts do all the inviting.  You just run the parties.
</UL>
<LI>I hate having to buy and maintain a huge inventory in my garage
<UL>
<LI>You don't deal with inventories with Scripture Creations.  You send in the order and the host distributes the products to the customers.
</UL>
<LI>I hate approaching people to sell them stuff
<UL>
<LI>With a party plan, your hosts do all the inviting.  You just run the parties.
</UL>
<LI>I hate selling over priced products to friends to cover my compensation
<UL>
<LI>Scripture Creations pricing is the same as it has been in retail stores for years.  There is no increase in the price of the products to cover sales reps payouts. 
</UL>
<LI>I hate that the people on top get a bigger percentage of the sale than the person making the sale
<UL>
<LI>The plan as currently designed gives 35% of all sales to the person making the sale.  No one else gets as high a percentage.
</UL>
<LI>I hate that it takes so long to develop a strong down-line
<UL>
<LI>Sorry, cannot help you there.  We all start at zero and add Sales Reps one or two at a time.  It's your business and you can build it as fast or slow as you like.  
<LI>Most people who declair bankruptcy would not have had to file if they had an additional $200 per month.  A party a week would get that for most Sales Reps even without signing up anyone else.

<H2>Why I LOVE Multi-Level Marketing</H2>
<H3>
<UL>
<LI>I love getting residual income from sales I did not personally make
<LI>I love getting residual income from my customers who order online
<LI>I love the association with good people committed to helping others build testimonies of Jesus Christ
<LI>I love the income potential Multi Levels bring
<LI>I love the flexability to work around my busy schedule
<LI>I love making a difference financially, socially, and spiritually in peoples lives
<LI>I love making friends
<LI>I love that Multi-Levels tend to grow in recessions. The worse the economy gets the more people want to be involved making some extra money.
<LI>I love having an extra income stream so I am not so vulnerable in hard times
<LI>I love not having a cap on my income
<LI>I love being in control of my time, my income, and my financial future
