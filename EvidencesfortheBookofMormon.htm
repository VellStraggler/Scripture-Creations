<H2><A NAME="Experience">Joseph Smith's Lack of Education and Experience</A></H2>
<P>With two years of formal education and growing up on the American frontier, 
Joseph Smith did not have the sophistication to write such a book as the Book of Mormon.</P>

<H2><A NAME="TranslationProcess">Translation Process</A></H2>
<P>Joseph never asked what he wrote last, never went back to revise, and verified the spelling of many names to his scribes. 
He would read a sentence and have the scribe read it back to him.  When it was correct, Joseph would see the next sentence.</P>

<H2><A NAME="Complexity">Translation Speed and Complexity</A></H2>
<P>The entire Book of Mormon was written in 75 days with no revisions.</P>

<H2><A NAME="UnmodifiedTestimony">Unmodified Testimony</A></H2>
<P>Joseph never denied his assertion that the Book of Mormon was translated from the Gold Plates.</P>

<H2><A NAME="Witnesses">Witnesses</A></H2>
<P>Three witnesses were shown the plates by an angel.  Although all three later left the church, none of them ever denied the experience. 
Eight other men were allowed to hold the plates and see the writing thereon, who also never denied the experience.</P>

<H2><A NAME="Demographics">Demographics and Population</A></H2>
<P>As the Book of Mormon progresses, the population growth is within expected ranges.</P>

<H2><A NAME="Geography">Book of Mormon Geography</A></H2>
<P>Over 80 different cities and locations are named in the Book of Mormon. Directions and distances are consistent throughout.</P>

<H2><A NAME="Arabia">Understanding of Arabia</A></H2>
<P>Locations for the valley of Lemuel, Nahum, and Bountiful have been found that match the distance and directions given in the 
Book of Mormon.  In Joseph Smith's day, Americans and Europeans did not think a place like Bountiful could exist in Arabia. </P>

<H2><A NAME="Style">Ancient Non-biblical Hebrew Poetic Style</A></H2>
<P>Found throughout the Book of Mormon and is beyond Joseph's ability to just make up. </P>

<H2><A NAME="Enoch">Ancient Book of Enoch Text Quoted</A></H2>
<P>The book of Enoch was discovered in 1888 and is quoted in the Book of Mormon, which came forth in 1830.</P>

<H2><A NAME="Weights">Weights and Measures</A></H2>
<P>The weights and measures described in Alma 11:3-19 are in use today by Myan descendants in Guatemala.</P>

<H2><A NAME="Warfare">Warfare</A></H2>
<P>Weapons and strategy evolve and become more advanced in response to earlier innovations. 
Guerrilla warfare (Gadianton Robbers) developed and changed as would be expected as the defenses, bases, supply chains, and circumstances changed.</P>

<H2><A NAME="Names">Book of Mormon Names</A></H2>
<P>Shakespeare came up with 60 new names.  The Book of Mormon brought forth 183 completely new names.  
All 183 are Semitic, which is the language family that includes Hebrew and Egyptian. 
There are over 20 exact or near-exact names, not found in the Bible, that have been confirmed to be names used in Lehi's day.</P>

<H2><A NAME="Robbers">Thieves and Robbers</A></H2>
<P>In ancient Israel, thieves were people in the community who stole from their neighbors.  
Robbers lived in the wilderness and often banded together to rob and pillage.  
Their punishment and view by society was very different. 
The New Testament translators used thieves for both words. 
The Book of Mormon keeps the distinction.</P>

<H2><A NAME="Warfare">Warfare</A></H2>
<P>Weapons and strategy evolve and become more advanced in response to earlier innovations. 
Guerrilla warfare (Gadianton Robbers) developed and changed as would be expected as the defenses, bases, supply chains, and circumstances changed.</P>

<H2><A NAME="Names">Book of Mormon Names</A></H2>
<P>Shakespeare came up with 60 new names.  The Book of Mormon brought forth 183 completely new names.  
All 183 are Semitic, which is the language family that includes Hebrew and Egyptian. 
There are over 20 exact or near-exact names, not found in the Bible, that have been confirmed to be names used in Lehi's day.</P>

<H2><A NAME="Idioms">Ancient Non-biblical Hebrew Idioms</A></H2>
<P>Idioms are the way of speaking or putting words together peculiar to a language. 
Some Book of Mormon examples of Hebrew idioms are: "turned himself around," "fallen into the hands of," "turned aside their ears," and "curious workmanship."</P>

<H2><A NAME="Septuagint">Septuagint Quotes</A></H2>
<P>The Book of Mormon agrees with the ancient Greek version of the bible in phrases that were lost in the Hebrew and King James Bible. 
Joseph Smith did not know Greek and did not have a copy of the Septuagint in 1829-1830.</P>
