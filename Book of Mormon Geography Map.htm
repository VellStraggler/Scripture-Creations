<H2 ALIGN="CENTER">Why Buy Scripture Creations Book of Mormon Geography Map</H2>
<P>
<B>Relative Geography -</B> Scripture Creations Book of Mormon Geography Map is not ment to match any current geographic location.  It is designed to be consistant according to the scriptures.
The LDS church has been very careful to not specify where the Book of Mormon actually took place.  Those members who have studied Book of Mormon Geography generally suscribe to the
theory of whichever book they have read.  With over 80 books and maps produced so far there is a huge variety of opinions. Teaching with a map that specifies a particular location may 
leave many members thinking about how your map is wrong instead of focusing on the principals you are trying to teach.  Relative geography is a much better option. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Colors -</B> Most Book of Mormon Geography Maps are made by intillectuals with no concern for asthetics.  Having a Book of Mormon Geography map that is asthetically pleasing increases its interest and 
encourages closer attention. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Use of ALL Scripture References -</B> While doing the research for this Book of Mormon Geography Map I found that most maps were made with a limited set of scriputres. 
I compiled my scripture reference lists initally by comparing the references I had against the list in books about Book of Mormon Geography.  
Each had some I did not and was missing many I had until I found John Sorenson's "Book of Mormon Geography, a Source Book". 
He had a complete set of scriptures references. Coincidently, his Book of Mormon relative geograph map is the most simular to our Scripture Creations version.  
The more pieces of the puzzle you use the more likely you are to have the correct picture at the end.

<H2 ALIGN="CENTER">Book of Mormon Geography Map Features</H2>
<P>
<img src="images/Missionary Legend.BMP" ALIGN="LEFT"><B>Missionary Journeys -</B> Each missionary journey is shown in a different color.  Quickly see where Alma went on each of his three missions. 
see where the sons of Mosiah served,  see where Nephi and Lehi travelled, etc.<BR><BR>
<B>Events that happened at each location with dates -</B> The back of the large, 19" x 26", map has a list of events that happened at each location along with the date when it happened. 
There is too much information to fit on the back of the smaller maps so the small maps just have a gazeteer and the scripture mastery scriptures on them. 
A BYU professor using our map in his class asked us if we could make the information about events with dates available for his students. 
We have created a product "Book of Mormon Map Companion" for those who buy the smaller versions but want the events and dates information.<BR>
<BR> 
<B>Gazeteer -</B> The map has a gazeteer on the back to help you quickly find any locaiton.<BR>
<BR> 
<img src="images/Map Legend.BMP" ALIGN="RIGHT"><B>Major Migration Routes -</B> All migrations of people are indicated on the Book of Mormon Geography Map. 
Nephi fleeing from the land of first inheritance to Nephi, Mosiah leaving Nephi for Zarahemla, Zenif's return, the travles of the Anti-Nephi-Lehis, 
the travels of the 2060 stripling warriors, Mormon's military campains, etc. 12 migrations in all.<BR><BR>
<B>City Informaiton -</B> Each city displays extra information about it if the Book of Mormon gives us any additional informaiton. 
Was the city fortified? Did it have a prison? How many cities had temples that we know of? <BR>
<BR>
<img src="images/Battles Legend.BMP" ALIGN="LEFT"><B>Where battles were fought -</B> Battles that were fought for cities were obviously fought at the city.  The rest of the battles are 
marked on the map with a map legend to easily match up the location to the scripture references for the battle.<BR><BR>
<B>Bringing the Book of Mormon to Life -</B> One of the best benefits of using a Book of Mormon Geography Map is that it helps make the people seem more real.
They lived in real places and had to travel from place to place.  They had their own customs.  When Nehor and Gideon had an arguement, a sword fight broke out.
 When they met someone on the trail there was a ceremony that took place.  Rivers had to be forded.  Stratigic places needed to be defended.  War tactics had to 
evolve as the population grew.  It is fun to get a glimpse of the lives of these people from so long ago.<BR><BR>
