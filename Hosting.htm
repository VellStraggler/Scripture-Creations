<H2>Hosting a Party</H2>
<H3>Hosting a party should be easy and fun.  It can all be done in four easy steps: <BR>
<UL>
<LI>Print invitations (on this page) or get them from your sales rep. Fill them out with your name and address and send them to 30 to 40 friends. On average, about 20% - 25% of those invited will come. 
<LI>Call your guests the day before the party to remind them, get RSVPs, and ask them to invite a friend.  Let your sales rep know how many will be attending. 
<LI>Have the party 
<LI>Distribute the products once they arrive from Scripture Creations.
</UL>

The party should take only about one hour!
